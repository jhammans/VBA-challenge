# VBA-challenge

## Description
VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

## Visuals
Screenshots of results are located in the images folder

## Usage
Import the stock_checker.vbs file into the workbook you wish to analyze.  The example workbooks provided by the instructor are located in the ../Starter_Code/Resources folder.  The code can only be ran once in a workbook without manually resetting the summary and aggregation results because some of the cell and range references are determined at runtime.  

## Roadmap
Possilbe future enhancements include re-writing the hardcoded cell and range values to make them dynamic to accomodate changes to the number of raw data columns and adding a routine to clear cells so the code can be run multiple times without manually clearing the summaries and aggregations.
